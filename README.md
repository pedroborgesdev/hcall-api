## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pedroborgesdev/hcall-api.git
cd hcall-api
cd api
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
go mod download
```

### 3. Configure environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your specific configuration
```

### 4. Start the application
```bash
go run .
```

## Environment Configuration

The application is highly configurable through environment variables:

```ini
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_NAME=hcall
DB_SSLMODE=disable

# Security Settings
USERNAME_MIN_CHAR=6
PASSWORD_MIN_CHAR=8
PASSWORD_SPECIAL=True
PASSWORD_DIGITS=True
PASSWORD_UPPERCASE=True
PASSWORD_LOWERCASE=True

# Worker Configuration
WORKER_TICKET_LOOPTIME=24        # Hours between worker runs
WORKER_TICKET_REMOVE_AFTER=30    # Days after which to remove tickets
WORKER_TICKET_REMOVE_STATUS=conclued

# Server Settings
PORT=8080
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRATION_HOURS=24
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. In production, use a strong, randomly generated JWT secret key.

## Security Architecture

The HCall API implements multiple layers of security:

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with secure signing and controlled expiration
- **Password Security**: Enforced complexity requirements and bcrypt hashing
- **Access Control**: Strict role validation for each API endpoint
- **Data Protection**: ACID-compliant transactions for critical operations
- **API Security**: Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging and history tracking
