## Security Architecture

The HCall API implements multiple layers of security:

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with secure signing and controlled expiration
- **Password Security**: Enforced complexity requirements and bcrypt hashing
- **Access Control**: Strict role validation for each API endpoint
- **Data Protection**: ACID-compliant transactions for critical operations
- **API Security**: Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging and history tracking
